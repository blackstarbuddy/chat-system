# chat-system
It's a one-on-one chat system between two user.
In this one is client and another is server.
It's just a basic program of networking showing networking work on python.

But remember if you are using this code ......then first run the server side of code and then run the client side of the code.....otherwise you will face the problems

And it also create a mdata file .....which store all the conversation between user and client
